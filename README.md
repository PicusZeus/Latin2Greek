===========

Citation detection tool for Greek and Latin texts.
Python 2.7. 

The tool is designed to find quotations, crypto-quotations and allusions from Greek authors in Latin texts and vice versa.
The principal part of the development involves creating a Latin to Greek dictionary based on existing translations  of ancient texts:
Eusebius and his version of the Bible, Aratus, Planudes's translations of Vergil and Caesar etc.
